Your task is to add progressive disclosure documentation and git conventions
to this repository.

Before starting:

1. Confirm you are inside the target repo's checked-out folder.
2. Ask whether to work on the current branch or create a new one.

Read these files from the ai-devkit repo
(https://github.com/AgoraIO-Community/ai-devkit.git):

1. docs/workflows/progressive-disclosure-docs.md#generate — the generation workflow
2. docs/workflows/progressive-disclosure-docs.md#test — the test workflow
3. docs/standard/progressive-disclosure-standard.md — the full standard

Deliverables:

1. Add AGENTS.md at the repo root using the expanded template from section 4.7
   of the progressive disclosure standard.
2. Generate progressive disclosure docs under docs/ai/.
3. Preserve and integrate with existing repo docs — don't overwrite them.
4. If CLAUDE.md already exists, add a reference to AGENTS.md using that file's
   existing conventions — don't replace content.
5. Apply these git conventions:
   - conventional commits
   - branch naming: type/short-description
   - no AI tool names in commit messages

Requirements:

- Read the whole repo, not just top-level files. Delegate large modules when
  the tool supports it.
- Read existing markdown, config, and CI files for project context.
- Use the real structure and terminology of the repo — no generic filler.
- Do not invent subsystems or workflows that aren't present yet.
- AGENTS.md must include How to Load, Git Conventions, and Doc Commands.
- Generate level zero, level one, and level two docs according to the standard. Add level two docs only
  where deeper detail is justified.
- After generating, run the test workflow. Fix failures and retest until all
  pass. Test results are saved to docs/ai/test-results.md.

When finished:

1. Summarize what you added.
2. Call out any assumptions, gaps, or ambiguous areas.
3. Commit with: docs: add progressive disclosure documentation
4. Push and create a PR.
